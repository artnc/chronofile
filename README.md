# Chronofile

This is a personal time tracking app designed and developed by and for myself.

You're welcome to try it out for yourself by installing an APK from the [releases](https://github.com/artnc/chronofile/releases) page, but be warned that the app requires Android 10+ and has undergone essentially zero QA! Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you're having problems.

All entries are written to a local TSV file in external storage for easy sync/backup.

I used this project to learn Kotlin and (re)learn Android development before I began work on the [Duolingo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo), which is [now 100% Kotlin](https://blog.duolingo.com/migrating-duolingos-android-app-to-100-kotlin/)!
