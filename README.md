# Chronofile

This is a personal time tracking app designed and developed by and for myself. More info at my [blog](https://chaidarun.com/ten-years-of-logging-my-life) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29692087).

You're welcome to try it out for yourself by installing an APK from the [releases](https://github.com/artnc/chronofile/releases) page, but be warned that the app requires Android 8.0+ and has undergone essentially zero QA! Please open a PR or issue if you're having problems.

All data is saved to a `Sync/chronofile.tsv` file in your device's local storage - nothing ever gets sent over the internet.

I used this project to learn Kotlin and (re)learn Android development before I began work on the [Duolingo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo), which is [now 100% Kotlin](https://blog.duolingo.com/migrating-duolingos-android-app-to-100-kotlin/)!
