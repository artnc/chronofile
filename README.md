# Chronofile

This is a personal time tracking app that I created for myself. More background at my [blog](https://chaidarun.com/ten-years-of-logging-my-life) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29692087).

You can try it out by installing an APK from the [releases](https://github.com/artnc/chronofile/releases) page. Please open a GitHub issue if you're having problems.

All data is saved to a `chronofile.tsv` file on your device. This app is 100% offline and never accesses the internet - no ads, no telemetry, nothing.

I used this project to learn Kotlin and relearn Android development before I began work on the [Duolingo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo), which is [now 100% Kotlin](https://blog.duolingo.com/migrating-duolingos-android-app-to-100-kotlin/)!
